ADAM'S README

OUR CSV FILES

UCR: the crimes reported by each local police department in the USA.  As of this writing we are only interested in the crimes reported by police departments in California, but that's OK!


ABC License: each California establishment (premise) with a license to sell alcohol.  Type of license (beer/wine vs liquor) and premise address are included.


OUR GOAL
  Using a Choropleth (D3JS thing; Google it), assess per capita[alcohol stores, violent crime, etc]

OTHER NOTES:
  early in development, I had to recreate my db, so some of the earliest migrations might be unavailable
