ADAM'S README

MODELS
  UCR: the crimes reported by each local police department in the USA.  As of this writing we are only interested in the crimes reported by police departments in California, but that's OK!

  ABC License: each California establishment (premise) with a license to sell alcohol.  Type of license (beer/wine vs liquor) and premise address are included.

  - we keep the state attribute to validate that all entries are California state; they all should be.
